//There should be ten events presented
//Write a text so that whenever the viewers selects, the initial page will be shown with the list of events 
//The texts style should be similar to a button 
//The detail of the events will show 
 //the 'name of the event', 
 //the 'presenter', 
 //the 'summary of the event', 
 //the 'location' (room), 
 //the 'date' and 
 //'time' of the event
