//Build an app that will have the following behaviors:
//Show a list of events coming from a 'JSON' file
//The 'list' will show 'event IDs' and 'event Names'
//If the viewer clicks on an event, the detail of that event will be presented
//There should be at least ten events presented
//Write a text so that whenever the viewers selects, the initial page will be shown with the list of events 
//The texts style should be similar to a button 
//The detail of the events will show 
	-the 'name of the event', 
	-the 'presenter', 
	-the 'summary of the event', 
	-the 'location' (room), 
	-the 'date' and 
	-'time' of the event
